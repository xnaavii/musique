    -   The fonts used are Agdasima for headings and Bacasime Antique for text; sans-serif as a fallback font.

-   ### Imagery
    -   Images were chosen in regards to the topic of the website; meaning that they were chosen to be calm and stylish and artistic.

    Here are the wireframes for each page:

## Bugs <h5>[Back To top](#contents)</h5>

### Known Bugs

-   Contact form does not actually send an email enquiry to anyone it just prompts a message as a thank you note.

### Fixed Bugs

-   Navigation bar would display a drop down menu after pressing any of the links while I was trying to set up a working dropdown menu. 
    <h3 align="center"><img src="assets/images/navigation-bar-bug.png"></h3>

    That was fixed by making the hover class display it as a flex so that it would appear properly. <h3 align="center"><img src="assets/images/navigation-bar-bug-fix.png"></h3>

-   Images from section one and two of the home page were not resizing with the window therefore they were making the text appear disproportionate. 
    <h3 align="center"><img src="assets/images/image-one-bug.png"></h3>
    <h3 align="center"><img src="assets/images/image-two-bug.png"></h3>
    
    Solution was to add images into separate divs of their own and set their max-width and auto height; from there I just had to position them.
