        <h3 align="center"><img src="assets/images/color-scheme.png"></h3>

-   ### Typography
    -   The fonts used are 'Libre Baskerville' for headings and 'Raleway' for text; 'sans-serif' as a fallback font.

-   ### Imagery
    -   Images were chosen in regards to the topic of the website; meaning that they were chosen to be minimalistic, related to page content.   

-   ### Wireframes
    I created wireframes using the wireframe [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/wireframes/desktop/#) website.

    The website has 4 pages, namely Home page, About Us page, Register and Sign in page. The website is also linked to a registration page, which takes user to registration form or if already a member, there is option to be taken to a sign in page.

    Here are the wireframes for each page:
    -   Home Page

    -   Register Page
