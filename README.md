  * The color palette
![Color Scheme](assets/readme-files/color-scheme.png)

* ### Typography

  * The fonts used are 'Libre Baskerville' for headings and 'Raleway' for text; 'sans-serif' as a fallback font.

* ### Imagery

  * Images were chosen in regards to the topic of the website; meaning that they were chosen to be minimalistic, related to the page content.

* ### Wireframes

    I created wireframes using the wireframe [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/wireframes/desktop/#) website.
